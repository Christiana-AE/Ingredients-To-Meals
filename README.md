# Ingredients To Meals ğŸ¥— ğŸ“–
Welcome to 'Ingredients To Meals', the meal prep application! The application developed is designed to help users plan and prepare meals based on the ingredients they have on hand. It could be particularly useful for individuals who are looking to use up ingredients they already have on hand before they go shopping for more, or for those who are trying to save money by minimizing food waste.

## Gettting Started!
To use the application, the user has to input information about the raw ingredients they have available in their refrigerator, as well as any allergies or dietary restrictions they may have. Once this information has been entered, the application will use third party application programming interfaces (APIs) to search for possible recipes and meal ideas that can be made using the ingredients the user has indicated they have available. 

The APIs will compare the user's ingredients to a database of menu items and return suggestions for meals that can be made with those ingredients, along with detailed recipes and cooking instructions. This will allow users to quickly and easily plan meals and make the most of the ingredients they have on hand, without having to spend time searching for recipes or menu ideas on their own.
